# Gemini agentic applications incremental design

Support repo for a 2 hours 40 minutes workshop that was first given at Ahlen's GDG on February 22 2025.

The workshop is split into 5 modules. Each module is in a separate subfolder. Ideally, we will go through each module in ~ 30 minutes. Here are the topics we will cover:

- [instrumenting Gemini LLMs basics](1-instrumenting-gemini-llms-basics/instrumenting-gemini-llms-basics.md)
- [calling LLMs with tools](2-calling-llms-with-tools/calling-llms-with-tools.md)
- [the ReAct pattern](3-the-react-pattern/the-react-pattern.md)
- [the plan and execute pattern](4-the-plan-and-execute-pattern/the-plan-and-execute-pattern.md)
- [multi-agent systems](5-multi-agent-systems/multi-agent-systems.md)

... all Python scripts are to be run from the folder of each module.

## setup and pre requisites
